# Example of using the math library in Python

# Formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2 * π * r
# Formula for the area of a circle: A = π * r²

import math  # Import the math module to access constants like π and functions like pow()

# Ask the user for the radius and store it as a floating-point number
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# Access the value of π (pi) from the math library
value_pi = math.pi

# Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * π * r
circumference = 2 * value_pi * radius
print(f"The circumference of the circle is {round(circumference, 2)}")  # Rounded to 2 decimal places

# Calculate the area using the formula A = π * r²
area = value_pi * pow(radius, 2)
print(f"The area of the circle is {round(area, 2)}")  # Rounded for neat output
