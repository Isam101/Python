# WHILE LOOP
# A while loop repeats code as long as a condition remains True.

# Ask the user to enter their age
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

# Keep asking until the user enters a non-negative age
while age < 0:
    print("You have entered a negative age.")
    age = int(input("Please enter your age again: "))

# Once the input is valid, show confirmation
print(f"You have entered a valid age. Your age is: {age}")
