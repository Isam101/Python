# FOR LOOPS
# A for loop executes a block of code a fixed number of times.
# You can iterate over ranges, strings, lists, and other sequences.

# Countdown from 10 to 1 using reversed() and range()
for x in reversed(range(1, 11)):
    print(x)

# Final message after the loop finishes
print("Happy New Year!!!!")
