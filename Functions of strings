# DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF STRINGS
# This script demonstrates common string operations in Python.

# Ask the user for their name
name = input("What is your name: ")

# len() → returns the length of a string (includes spaces)
print(f"The length of your name is: {len(name)}")

# find() → finds the first occurrence (index) of a character
result = name.find("I")
print(f"The first occurrence of 'I' is at index: {result}")

# rfind() → finds the last occurrence (from the end)
result = name.rfind("I")
print(f"The last occurrence of 'I' is at index: {result}")

# capitalize() → capitalizes only the first letter
print(f"Capitalized version: {name.capitalize()}")

# upper() → converts all letters to uppercase
print(f"Uppercase version: {name.upper()}")

# lower() → converts all letters to lowercase
print(f"Lowercase version: {name.lower()}")

# isalpha() → checks if the string contains only alphabetic characters (no spaces or numbers)
print(f"Contains only letters? {name.isalpha()}")

# count() → counts how many times a character or substring appears in a string
phone = "778-751-4162"
result = phone.count("-")
print(f"Number of dashes in phone number: {result}")

# replace() → replaces part of a string with another
new_phone = phone.replace("-", " ")
print(f"Phone number with spaces instead of dashes: {new_phone}")
