# USING INDEXING
# This program takes a credit card number and hides all but the last four digits.

# Ask the user for their credit card number
Credit_Card_Number = input("Please enter your credit card number: ")

# Extract the last four digits using negative indexing
Last_Four_digits = Credit_Card_Number[-4:]

# Display a masked version of the credit card number
print(f"(XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-{Last_Four_digits})")
