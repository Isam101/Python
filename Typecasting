#Typecasting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another str(),int(), float(),bool()

name = "Isam Eldin"
age =27
GPA = 3.5
is_student = True

#Get the data type
type(name) #type function allows us to see the data type once we use it with print function 
print(type(name)) # In this case we have a data type of string thus <class 'str'> is printed
print(type(age)) # In this case we have a data type of string thus <class 'int'> is printed
print(type(GPA)) # In this case we have a data type of string thus <class 'float'> is printed
print(type(is_student)) # In this case we have a data type of string thus <class 'bool'> is printed


#Typecasting 
GPA_2 = int(GPA)
print(f"The new GPA is {GPA_2}") # Original GPA is 3.5 in float but in int its 3

AGE_2 = float(age)
print(f"What is your age again {AGE_2}") #Original age is 27 but then when we change the data type to float it becomes 27.0 

age = str(age)
print(f"My age in string is {age}")
#To prove that age has been changed from int to string we can use type and print again 
print(type(age)) # And the class has been changed to <class 'str'>

# For bool we can use it to check if someone has entered there name or not 
name = bool(name)
print(f"Have you entered a name {name}")

# It showed true on the first test as there is a name typed on the variable now lets change that 
name =""
name = bool(name) 
print(f"Have you entered a name {name}") # Now you can see that the result is changed to false as there is no string originally entered
