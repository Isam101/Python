# Exercise 2 - Shopping cart program

# Prompt the user to enter the item they want to buy
Item = input("what are you getting today: ")

# Ask for the price of the item and convert it to a float 
# since price can include decimal values
Price = float(input(f"The Price of the item {Item} is: "))

# Ask for the quantity and convert it to float 
Quantity = int(input(f"How many of {Item} are you getting today:  "))

# Calculate the total cost by multiplying price and quantity
Total = Quantity * Price 

# Display the total cost to the user
print (f"The total today is {Total}")
