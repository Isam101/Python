# IF STATEMENTS
# Example: Simple Python Calculator
# This program performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

# Ask the user to select a mathematical operator
operator = input("Enter an operator (*, /, -, +): ")

# Ask the user to input two numbers and convert them to float for decimal support
number1 = float(input("Please enter the first number: "))
number2 = float(input("Please enter the second number: "))

# Perform multiplication
if operator == "*":
    print(f"The result of multiplication: {number1 * number2}")

# Perform division (includes a check to avoid dividing by zero)
elif operator == "/":
    if number2 == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        print(f"The result of division: {number1 / number2}")

# Perform addition
elif operator == "+":
    print(f"The result of addition: {number1 + number2}")

# Perform subtraction
elif operator == "-":
    print(f"The result of subtraction: {number1 - number2}")

# Handle invalid operators
else:
    print("Invalid operator! Please enter one of: *, /, +, -")
