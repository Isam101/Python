# INDEXING
# Accessing specific elements of a sequence (like a string) using [start:end:step]

# Example string
Username = "34343-23333-2333"

# Access the first character (index 0)
print(Username[0])  # Output: '3'

# Slicing example [start:end:step]
# This takes characters from index 0 up to (but not including) index 5, stepping by 2
print(Username[0:5:2])  # Output: '343'

# Explanation:
# [start:end:step]
# start → where the slice begins (index 0)
# end → where the slice stops (index 5, but not including 5)
# step → how many characters to skip between each index
