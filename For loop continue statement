# FOR LOOP WITH CONTINUE STATEMENT
# The 'continue' keyword skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

for x in range(1, 21):
    # Skip the number 13
    if x == 13:
        continue
    else:
        print(x)

# Basically what happens is that code starts to be excuted then when x is thirteen the code doesn't go to else statement where the print command is being performed.
