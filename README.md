🐍 Python Journey

Learning Python from scratch and documenting my progress through simple scripts, exercises, and mini-projects.
This repo tracks my growth from basic syntax to real problem-solving.
All code is beginner-friendly, well-commented, and continuously improving as I build a strong foundation for engineering and future AI work.
