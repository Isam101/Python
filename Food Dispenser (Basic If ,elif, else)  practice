# IF STATEMENTS
# Example: Food Dispensing System
# The program checks user input and performs actions based on their response.

# Ask the user if they would like food
Food = input("Would you like some food? (Y for Yes and N for No): ")

# If the user enters 'Y', prepare the food
if Food == "Y":
    print("Your food is ready for pickup at Station One.")

# If the user enters 'N', skip food preparation
elif Food == "N":
    print("You have chosen not to get food. Please proceed to the exit.")

# If the user enters anything else, show an error message
else:
    print("Invalid entry. Please type 'Y' for Yes or 'N' for No.")
