#Input() = A function that prompts the user to enter data, Returns the entered data as a string 
# User Inputs their name and age after being prompted to do so 
name = input("Please enter your name: ") 
age = input("what is your age as well: ")


print(f"Is your name {name} ")
print(f"Are you of age {age} ")
# The data type entered is in string 
print(type(age))

#print(age+1)# we will get an error as we can not conatenate str with an integer

# Checked the data type of age and switched it to int 
age = int(age) 
print(type(age))
age+1
print(f"{age+1}") # Now it works as we have switched the data type to int and concatenated ints 

# We can also type cast the input so we don't have to do it later example

AGE = int(input("What is your age again: " ) )  # 


print (type(AGE))#The result is <class 'int'>
print(f"what is your age after your birthday: {AGE+1}") # Thus we can so arithmetic
