# WHILE LOOP WITH SENTINEL VALUE
# This loop continues to run until the user enters 'q' to quit.

# Ask the user for their favorite food
food = input("Please enter a food you like (enter 'q' to quit): ")

# Repeat as long as the user does NOT enter 'q'
while food != "q":
    print(f"You like {food}")
    food = input("Please enter another food you like (enter 'q' to quit): ")

# Once the user enters 'q', the loop ends
print("You have quit the program.")
