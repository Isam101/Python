# EXERCISE: Validate User Input
# Rules:
# 1) Username must be no more than 12 characters
# 2) Username must not contain spaces
# 3) Username must not contain digits

# Ask the user for a username
username = input("Please enter your preferred username (max 12 characters, no spaces, no digits): ")

# Check if username is too long
if len(username) > 12:  # Checks the total length of the username
    print("You have entered more than 12 characters.")

# Check if username contains spaces
elif " " in username:  # If a space is found in the string, this condition is True
    print("You have a space in your username.")

# Check if username contains digits or non-letter characters
elif not username.isalpha():  # isalpha() returns True only if all characters are letters
    print("Your username contains numbers or special characters — only letters are allowed.")

# If all conditions are satisfied
else:  # Runs if none of the previous conditions are True
    print(f"✅ Your username is valid: {username}")
