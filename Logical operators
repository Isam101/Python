# LOGICAL OPERATORS
# Logical operators are used to evaluate multiple conditions:
#   or  → at least one condition must be true
#   and → both conditions must be true
#   not → reverses (negates) a condition

# Example scenario: Checking weather conditions
temp = 25
Is_Raining = False

# "and" means both conditions must be True
if temp <= 25 and Is_Raining:
    print("The temperature is 25 degrees or less AND it is raining.")

# "or" means at least one condition must be True
elif temp > 25 or Is_Raining:
    print("It is either hot OR raining (or both).")

# "not" inverts a condition
elif not temp == 24:
    print("The temperature is NOT 24 degrees.")

# If none of the conditions are True, this block runs
else:
    print("The temperature is 24 degrees and it is not raining.")
