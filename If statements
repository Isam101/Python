# IF STATEMENTS
# An if statement allows the program to perform certain actions if a condition is true,
# and perform different actions if it is false (using else).

# Ask the user for their age and convert it to an integer
age = int(input("What is your age: "))

# Check if the user is under 18
if age < 18:
    # Condition is TRUE if the user's age is less than 18
    print("You are not old enough to get a credit card. Try again next year.")

# If the above condition is FALSE (age is 18 or older), this code runs instead
else:
    print("You are eligible to get a credit card! Congratulations, follow the next steps.")
